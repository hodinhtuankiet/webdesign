                        In New York, the former NYPD detective Ben Carson is hired to work as night watch of the remains
                        of the Mayflower Department Store that was partially destroyed by fire many years ago. Ben
                        became alcoholic and was retired from the police force after killing a man in a shooting. His
                        marriage was also destroyed and now he is living in the apartment of his younger sister Angie.
                        However he has not been drinking for three months and sees the employment as a chance to rebuild
                        his life. When he goes to the rounds in his first night, he finds that the mirrors are
                        impeccably clean and his colleague explains that the former night watch was obsessed with the
                        mirrors. After a couple of nights, Ben sees weird images in the mirrors, but due to the lack of
                        credibility of his past, his ex-wife Amy believes he has hallucinations as a side effect of his
                        medication. When Angie is found brutally murdered in her bathtub, Ben discovers that there is an
                        evil force in the mirror that is chasing him and jeopardizing his family.

                        Always thought there was an evil design behind all those giant mirrors at clothes stores. But
                        how evil are they? Put Alexandre Aja behind the camera, and what do you think?</p>
